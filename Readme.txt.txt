INTRODUCTION

The final task of Master in Data Science at Kschool is to make a Data Science project about one topic of multiple subjects we learnt during the academic year 
in order to achieve the goal of master Data Science skills, the chosen one in this Master’s Dissertation was a Content-Based Movie Recommender.

This project combines NLP with a recommendation engine to build an alternative engine away from typical recommender engines which are based in opinions or 
rating, in fact this recommendation is based on “content”, specifically this is a movie recommender, so we want content like description, genres, actors, etc.

The project is completely done in python, all code is in a Jupyter Notebook which include the reading of the data to an example of the output. The data and 
the notebook can be found at:

MANUAL

The dataset is not the same as you find in the link, the dataset has been preprocessed before because it was a json type file which needs too many lines to clean
it up, so we decided to remove them and clean the dataset like it was pandas dataframe originally.

First, of all you only have to extract zip file and run the notebook in the same folder as dataset file. All libraries and packages are included in the notebook and
every user can run it without adding any extra libraries to python.

WARNING: The project needs a high-performance machine to run all the lines, it was used a machine with 6vCPU and 64 GB of memory provided by IBM, so it’s highly 
recommended a high-performance computer or cloud storage with same specifications or better.
